# homeautomation
i want the simple home automation system using html talwind css and javascript with esp32 and flutter for mobile app.
actually there are two ways of doing it. 
1) in the first method, my esp32 will works as a websocket server and my flutter app and react will work as a websocket client. and it is working fine. but the problem in this case is we need to connect my mobile and the esp32 to the same wifi network then only it is working. but the problem is why someone who has the internet access in his or her mobile then why should anyone connect with the wifi network. so we can resolve it in the second case


2) in the second case what would we do is. we will make a centralie server like flask and in this case my esp32, react js and my flutter app all will be work as a websocket client. so by doing this way we can control everything through our mobile from anywhere in the world
